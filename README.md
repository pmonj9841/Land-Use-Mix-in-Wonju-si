# Land-Use-Mix-in-Wonju-si
This project deals with a question, 'how well land uses in Wonju-si are mixed?' Mixed land uses has many adavantages including reduction in demands for long-trips. Many methodologies have been developed to quantify the level of land use mix. One of them is Entropy index.

where Pj is the percentage of each land use type j and k is the total number of land use types in the area (Voukenas, 2021). 

I developed this methodology to improve the results: 
- First, I categorized land uses into three categories so that the collaborations of land uses that don't have synergy doesn't improve the results.
- Second, I duplicated residential-commercial buildings and assigned one for residential type and one for commercial type. This is to take them into account in our model.
